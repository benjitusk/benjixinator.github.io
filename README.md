# Rain.js
Hey, thanks for checking out my game!
The gameplay is pretty simple: protect the ball from the rain.

Iâ€™m planning on adding more progression to the game, e.g. the rain gets
heavier as the game goes on, or the umbrella shrinks, etc. 
Feedback is greatly appreciated!
If there is a bug, or a feature request, 
shoot me an email at benjitusk1@gmail.com
